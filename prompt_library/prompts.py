prompt_library/prompts.py
=========================
Central place to store prompt templates so you can iterate on system/role
instructions without touching business logic.  Right now we expose a single
`SYSTEM_PROMPT` (LangChain `SystemMessage`)

Customising the system prompt
-----------------------------
Simply open this file and edit the `content` string.  Because the agent prepends
the system prompt on *every* LLM invocation, changes are immediately reflected
across the entire workflow.

You can also create additional variables (e.g. `USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) and use
them wherever needed.
