# Full-Stack LLMOps

This project is a boilerplate for building full-stack applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured foundation for developing and deploying LLM-based solutions with features like agentic workflows, tool integration, and configuration management.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the key directories in this project:

```
├── agents/             # Logic for LLM agents and their workflows
├── config/             # Application configuration files (e.g., config.yaml)
├── exception/          # Custom exception handling
├── experiments/        # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
├── logger/             # Logging configuration and setup
├── prompt_library/     # A library for storing and managing prompts
├── tools/              # Tools that can be used by LLM agents
├── utils/              # Utility functions and helper classes
├── main.py             # Main script to run the application
├── app.py              # Web application entry point (e.g., for Flask or FastAPI)
├── requirements.txt    # Python package dependencies
└── setup.py            # Script for building and distributing the project
```
